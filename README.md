## Description

Spacecraft missions return massive amounts of valuable data, but those data can be hard to access, analyze, and interpret. Asteroids, comets, and small moons present additional challenges: the irregular shapes of these bodies are ill-suited for two-dimensional projections.
 
The Small Body Mapping Tool (SBMT) addresses these challenges. The SBMT is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize and manipulate small body shape models in three dimensions. The Tool enables quick and easy searches for spacecraft data of a variety of small bodies. Once selected, data can be projected directly onto the shape models, and built-in analysis and mapping capabilities facilitate scientific investigations.
 
The SBMT has been used by several flight mission teams, including Dawn, Rosetta, OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa2, MMX, Lucy, and Dragonfly. Mission-specific shape models, data, and features will be available to all SBMT users once the mission data become publicly available.

## Referencing the Small Body Mapping Tool
